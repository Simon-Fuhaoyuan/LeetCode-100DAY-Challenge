# LeetCode-100DAY-Challenge

## Usage

In each subfolder, there will be a `makefile` using `g++` to complie the `main.cpp` and generate `run.exe`. You can use
```shell
make
./run.exe
```
to run the file. If I miss `makefile` in some subfolder, you can just copy one from other subfolders.

Note that for solutions for some questions, I didn't give a `main()` function, so ignore them or you can write an example yourself.

Since last challenge, I update this repo from time to time, but miss the target of daily updating. Currently, this repository contains 232 answers of Leetcode problems. I will continue updating this repo, but I cannot promise the frequency. Looking forward to next challenge!

Hi, long time no see! 

I'm recently working on a scholarship which will have a programming test. I will do some exercise and make some updates these days.
